-. Create templates to limit actions within plugins
  - Scan plugin for all actionable items
  - Enable access to limit which action-calls that can be made in which template
  
  Example: Plugin X has actions for showing content on the side but there's no need to load actions for the administrative interface this these can be disabled unless you're in the admin-interface

- Device templates
   - Enable templates based on the HTTP_USER_AGENT as different plugins may be necessary depending on what client browser that's used, mobile vs. desktop for instance

- Fix design
  - Needs to look a bit fancier

- Enable plugins in default template upon Activate by default rather than having to enabling it within Selective Loading as well
